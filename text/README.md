% An Alternative Introduction to `std`

This is intended to be a comprehensive guide into Rust's standard library.

While `std` is indeed nicely documented, such documentation by its nature couldn't serve as an introduction to novices.

The goal of this set of posts is to provide an alternative to help novice Rust learners build up a structurelized understanding of the library step by step. It should cover general use cases, demonstrate part of the implementation, and hopefully help readers pick up some useful Rust tricks along the way.

This is a work in progress at its very early stages, as such, any kind of suggestions or help would be appreciated.
