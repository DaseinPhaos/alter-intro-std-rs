# Introduction

This is intended to be a comprehensive guide towards Rust's standard library.

While `std` has a nice documentation, I find it somewhat difficult to get a structuralized understanding of it by heading into its doc directly.

The goal of this set of posts is to provide an alternative way to help novice Rust learners like me to set up some level of understanding of the library, its use cases, its implementations and so on, and hopefully to pick up some useful Rust tricks along the way.
